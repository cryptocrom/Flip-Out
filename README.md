Coin Flip DApp Project

August 2020
This is my first project that I have ever created.
I have designed a DApp from start to finish to bring the Front End, the Back End and the Blockchain together in a simple Coin Flip DApp.
HTML and CSS for front end
JavaScript (jQuery) used for functionality on front end.
Solidity used for Smart Contract.


**Update - 20 September 2020
I have now completed my project, contracts have been rewritten almost entirely.
I have created extra games (a dice roll game and high card draw game also).
6 webpages (home page, rules page, owner page, and a page for each of the games).
Each page has uniformity and style consistency and interlinks with other pages and the owner page link is protected with a password.
The result messages sometimes spit out the wrong message, but I believe this to be slow communication lag from the contract at times perhaps.
I may need to look into asynchronous functions perhaps?? Its a work in progress.
